# predict-author-features
Text in the form of blogs, posts, articles, etc. is written every second. It is a challenge to predict the information about the writer without knowing about him/her. We are going to create a classifier that predicts multiple features of the author of a given text. We have designed it as a Multilabel classification problem.
